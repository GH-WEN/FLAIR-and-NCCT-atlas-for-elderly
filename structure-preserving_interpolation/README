imiSliceInterpolation

This is C++ code to implement the slice-wise registration-based interpolation 
of 3D input images as described in:
  Ehrhardt, J., SÃ¤ring, D., & Handels, H. (2007). Structure-preserving interpolation 
  of temporal and spatial image sequences using an optical flow-based method. 
  Methods of information in medicine, 46(03), 300-307.
Please cite this paper if you use this code in your research projects.

Instead of the optical-flow based registration method, we use a symmetric diffeomorph
variational registration with demon forces and diffusive regularization. See 
  Werner, R., Schmidt-Richberg, A., Handels, H., & Ehrhardt, J. (2014). Estimation 
  of lung motion fields in 4D CT data by variational non-linear intensity-based 
  registration: A comparison and evaluation study. 
  Physics in Medicine & Biology, 59(15), 4247.
for a description of the registration method.


To compile and install the source code you need:
CMake - 3.10.1 or higher
ITK   - 4.9.1 or higher (untested for version >= 5.0.0)
        Compile ITK with remote module VariationalRegistration 
        (set Module_VariationalRegistration ON) 

To compile and test the code use:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src
make
bin/imiSliceInterpolation -I INPUT_IMAGE -O OUTPUT_IMAGE -a 3 -l 6 -i 1000

This will take some time.

INPUT_IMAGE and OUTPUT_IMAGE must be 3D images and use file formats readable/writeable by ITK

The result should be identical to data/boss001.1_t2_highres.nii.gz .
